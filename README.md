### AWS Guard Duty

Guard Duty is an intelligent threat-detection service that provides customers with a way to continuously monitor and protect their AWS accounts and workloads. GuardDuty identifies suspected attackers through integrated threat intelligence feeds and uses machine learning (ML) to detect anomalies in account and workload activity. It monitors for activity such as unusual API calls or unauthorized deployments that indicate that a customerâ€™s accounts might have been compromised. It also monitors direct threats, like compromised instances or reconnaissance by attackers.
Since it is managed service as soon as you activate it, AWS provision all needed permissions to get access & inject CloudTrail, VPC Flow, DNS logs to Guard Duty and analyze them for anomalies, known threat patterns, malicious IP address, known malicious DNS request, known Crypto Mainin addresses,  etc. Admin has to implicitly enable additonal services - like EKS Log monitoring, Lambda, Malware EC2 and container image scans.

To learn more, see Amazon GuardDuty
There is an [option to manage GuarDuty with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_organizations.html) through delegated GuardDuty Admin AWS account - add members, enable Protection plans, suspend/disable GD in indovidual AWS accounts etc.
Guard Duty has to be enabled on per region basis. Auto-Enable for new Accounts is configurable.
