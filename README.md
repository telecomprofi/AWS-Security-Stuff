### AWS Guard Duty
Amazon GuardDuty 

is an intelligent threat-detection service that provides customers with a way to continuously monitor and protect their AWS accounts and workloads. GuardDuty identifies suspected attackers through integrated threat intelligence feeds and uses machine learning (ML) to detect anomalies in account and workload activity. It monitors for activity such as unusual API calls or unauthorized deployments that indicate that a customerâ€™s accounts might have been compromised. It also monitors direct threats, like compromised instances or reconnaissance by attackers.

### AWS Security Hub
 gives you a single pane of glass view of your high-priority security alerts and compliance status across AWS accounts. It provides you a single place that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie, in addition to AWS Partner solutions.

### AWS Inspector
automatically discovers workloads, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and Lambda functions, and scans them for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

Amazon Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continually scans workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.
